# HALL OF FAME

I am the guy who believes in Participating and Performing in every possible Opportunity whether Iâ€™ll get recognized for it or not (However, like every other Homo Sapien, I also like it when anyone recognizes me for what I have achieved as it boosts my will to perform much better). I always try to participate in any kind of event or opportunity I get either to showcase my potential or sometimes to test my Potential. In any way, Whenever the words of any event reach my Ears, It becomes difficult for me to neutralize my urge to participate in that event.

Although I was not like this before, I used to be the kind of person who use to wait for the next opportunity to come so that I can learn from others attempts but all of this has changed when I got the opportunity to study at Sir Padampat Singhania Education Center, Kanpur. My relocation to Kanpur for studies where no one can judge me for my past experiences gave me immense confidence and freedom to try out new opportunities which I used to neglect in my Home Town. This new confidence motivated me to become a better version of myself that helped me to collect all the Below Mentioned tokens of Achievements.
